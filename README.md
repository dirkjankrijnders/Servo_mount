Servo mount
===========

Based on several threads on the dutch three-rail model railroad site (for example [here](http://forum.3rail.nl/index.php?topic=36707.msg814683#msg814683)]), I came up with the idea to combine a PCB of say a decoder with the mechnical mounting of a servo. (cheap to manufacture on small scale and very precise). The result:
